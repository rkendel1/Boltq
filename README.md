# BoltNewClone

![Project Banner](./public/WorkingImage.png)

A modern Next.js web application inspired by Bolt, featuring AI-powered chat and code tools, authentication, and workspace management. Built with TypeScript, Convex, and a modular component structure.

## Features

- AI Chat and Code Generation (OpenAI integration)
- **OpenAPI Workflow Builder** - Transform any API into conversational workflows
- **Magoc Backend Integration** - Process OpenAPI specifications automatically
- User Authentication
- Workspace Management
- Modular UI Components
- Convex backend for real-time data
- Responsive and modern design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- Bun (optional, for faster installs)
- Convex account (for backend)

### Installation

```bash
bun run install # or npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys and configuration.

### Running Locally

```bash
bun run dev # or npm run dev
```

### Convex Setup

1.  Install Convex CLI: `npm install -g convex`
2.  Run `npx convex dev` to start the backend.

BoltNewClone is a modern, TypeScript-based Next.js application inspired by Bolt. It combines AI-powered chat & code tools, user authentication, and workspace management with a Convex backend for real-time data.

## Quick overview

- AI-first chat and code helpers (API routes under `app/api/`)
- User sessions and auth routes
- Workspace-centric UI and components in `components/workspace`
- Convex-powered backend and schema in `convex/`

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (or the version compatible with your Next.js setup)
- Bun (optional) or npm/yarn/pnpm for installs
- Convex account (for production/back-end development)

## Quickstart (local)

1. Copy env file and add keys

```zsh
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and fill required keys (API keys, Convex url, etc.)
```

2. Install dependencies

```zsh
# using bun (recommended if installed)
bun install

# or with npm
npm install
```

3. Start Convex (if you use Convex locally)

```zsh
npx convex dev
```

4. Run the dev server

```zsh
bun dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Environment

Use the `.env.example` file as the authoritative list of variables. Copy it to `.env` and fill values used by your AI integrations and Convex. If you want, add the banner image at `public/banner.png` (or update the path in this README).

## Project structure

```
app/              # Next.js app dir (routes, API handlers, pages)
  api/            # API routes including OpenAPI and workflow endpoints
  openapi-builder/ # OpenAPI workflow builder page
components/       # UI components (Header, Hero, workspace views)
  openapi/        # OpenAPI-specific components (uploader, viewer, builder)
configs/          # AI model config (e.g. `configs/AIModel.ts`)
context/          # React context providers
convex/           # Convex schema, functions and generated code
data/             # Static data like prompts, lookups, colors
docs/             # Documentation including Magoc integration guide
lib/              # Utilities and helpers
  services/       # Backend service clients (e.g., backendService.ts)
  types/          # TypeScript type definitions (e.g., openapi.ts)
providers/        # App-wide providers (Convex client, Theme, Message)
public/           # Static assets (put banner image here)
```

## OpenAPI Workflow Integration

This project integrates with the [Magoc backend](https://github.com/rkendel1/Magoc) to process OpenAPI specifications and create conversational workflows.

### Quick Start

1. Start the Magoc backend:
   ```bash
   uvx automagik-tools@latest serve --tool genie --transport sse --port 8000
   ```

2. Add the backend URL to `.env`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MAGOC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. Access the API Builder at `/openapi-builder` after signing in

For detailed integration instructions, see [docs/MAGOC_INTEGRATION.md](docs/MAGOC_INTEGRATION.md)

## Notes on Convex

This app uses Convex for real-time storage and server functions. If you don't need Convex during local development you can skip `npx convex dev`, but some features (workspaces, live updates) will be unavailable.

If you plan to deploy, set up a Convex project and point your `.env` to the production Convex URL / keys.

## Development tips

- Replace `public/banner.png` with your project image. The README references that file so GitHub will render it.
- Edit pages in `app/` and components in `components/` — Next 13+ app dir supports fast refresh.
- AI model selection lives in `configs/AIModel.ts`.

## Tests and lints

This template doesn't include a test runner by default. Add your preferred tooling (Jest/Playwright/Testing Library, ESLint) as needed.

## Deployment

- Deploy on Vercel for a frictionless Next.js deployment. Connect your repository and set the environment variables in the Vercel dashboard. If you use Convex, make sure the Convex URL/keys are set in production envs.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Open issues or PRs, describe the change, and include a short test or screenshot where helpful.
